<p>
  MUSEApp is a xamarin forms project which builds a mobile application for iOS and Android to communicate with MUSEWebService, which
  is a RESTful API service that communicates with c++ programs that run various algorithms. The c++ programs output their data to a
  JSON file, which the Web Service then reads and returns the data to the mobile application. MUSECommonLibrary provides a library 
  with common code and data models that are used by all existing projects in the solution.
